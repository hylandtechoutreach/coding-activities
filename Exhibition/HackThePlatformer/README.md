# Hack the Platformer
This activity is designed to introduce basic coding at events where Hyland has a table setup (e.g., Score with STEM). The goal is for event participants to play the game, then edit some game settings to make the game their own. Players should try to beat the high score... and if they can't, they can try hacking the game to make it easier.

## Description
In this activity, students will play a simple platformer video game, and see if they can achieve a high score. There is one twist: they will be able "hack" the game by changing the code! This quick demonstration introduces computer science in a fun, interactive way. Students will explore programming and critical thinking skills, and see how these skills can translate into a software development career.

## Quick Pitch
Play a simple platformer video game, and then learn how to hack it! Get a high score and see how programming and critical thinking can lead to a lifelong passion and a lucrative career in software development.
