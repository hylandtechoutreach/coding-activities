# Hack the Platformer
This activity is designed to introduce basic coding at events where Hyland has a table setup (e.g., Score with STEM). The goal is for event participants to play the game, then edit some game settings to make the game their own. Players should try to beat the high score... and if they can't, they can try hacking the game to make it easier.
