# Exhibition Game: Hack the Platformer
This activity is designed to introduce basic coding at events where Hyland has a table setup (e.g., Score with STEM). The goal is for event participants to play the game, then edit some game settings to make the game their own. Players should try to beat the high score... and if they can't, they can try hacking the game to make it easier.

- [Click here to view and remix the code.](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/platformer-hacker)

## Resources
To make this work most efficiently, there should be:

- One laptop
- One monitor
- One keyboard
- One mouse
- Access to power for the laptop/monitor

## Setting Up
Before students start arriving, set things up so that the participants have access to the keyboard, mouse, and monitor. The screen can be duplicated on the laptop, and the facilitator should be able to control anything as needed.

1. Open the [starter project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/platformer-hacker)
1. Click the "Remix" button to create a new project playground
1. Open the **variables.js** file
1. Close the file list on the left
1. Open the **ðŸ”Ž PREVIEW** section from the bottom menu
1. Drag the preview pane to make it bigger
1. Go full screen
1. Zoom in as much as possible

The window on the monitor should look something like this:

## Process
If a participant wants to interact, follow these steps:

1. Re-open and re-remix the original [starter project](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/platformer-hacker)  
    - This way, each participant has their own personal version of the game
1. Let the participant play the game, and tell them to try to beat the high score  
    - Keep track of one main high score for the whole event
    - Give a prize (candy/swag) to anyone who beats the high score
1. Show the participant the **variables.js** file
1. Explain that the _variables_ control the gameplay  
    - In computer science, variables are containers for data
1. Let the participant change around some variables, and replay the game
1. See if they can beat their former score with new variable settings
1. When they are done, tell them they can play their game at the auto-generated URL  
    - e.g., `rowan-nosy-laundry.glitch.me`
