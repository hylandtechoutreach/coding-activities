# Blooket Setup
[Blooket](https://www.blooket.com/) is a fun formative assessment tool that's similar to Kahoot, but more game-based. There are a variety of game modes where the students compete against each other in different ways. Answering questions correctly helps them achieve more success in each game.

An account is required to host the game; here are some credentials you can use:

- Username: **techoutinst**
- Password: **Tech0utreach**

When setting up the game, try to time it so that it ends just a couple minutes before the overall session ends. Note that it will likely take 2-3 minutes for all the students to join the game, so a game time limit of **7 minutes** might end up taking about **10 minutes**. In general, **7 minutes** is a pretty good amount of time. For a 90 minute lesson plan, **10** or **12** minutes may be a good time limit - it depends on when the Blooket begins.
