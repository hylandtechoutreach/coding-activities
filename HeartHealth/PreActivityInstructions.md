# Pre-Activity Instructions: Heart-Healthy Website
## Recommendations
- We recommend a desktop, laptop, or Chromebook for this virtual activity.
- If you have multiple devices available, it will be beneficial to join the Bizzabo meeting from one device, and write code using a separate device. For example, if you have two laptops, you could join the Bizzabo meeting from one of the laptops, and write code on the other laptop.
- An ideal situation for a Chromebook user would be to also have access to a laptop or desktop to use as a second device. That said, if you do not have any other devices, we hope you still try to participate as best you can! 
- We **do not** recommend using a phone or tablet as your only device for the virtual activity. This is because the size of those screens may make it difficult to participate in the activities. If you must use one, it may be easier to watch instead of following along.

## Before the Activity
Make sure you can properly open **[Repl](https://repl.it/@JosephMaxwell/HeartHealthy#index.html)** on your device. It should look like this:

From there, click on the "Fork" button at the top of the page:

Now you have a Repl account! Remember the username and password so you can log in during the activity.

## During the Activity - Single Device
You will not be able to take the steps listed below until the activity starts during the STEM Goes Red for Girls event. However, please review these steps ahead of time to get familiar with how you will use the Bizzabo platform during the coding activity.

1. Scroll down to the meeting area. It should look something like this:

1. Move the Bizzabo meeting window to the left side of your screen, and adjust the size of the window so it only takes up the left half of the screen.
1. Move the Repl window to the right side of the screen, so both the Bizzabo meeting and the Repl window are visible:

1. Adjust as needed. You should be able to see the code from the instructor’s screen AND your own code.

If desired, it is also possible to switch between the Bizzabo window and the Repl window throughout the code-along. Whatever works best for you!

## During the Activity - Multiple Devices
If you have multiple devices, use one device to view the Bizzabo meeting, and another device to write the code. In order to share your code at the end, we recommend joining the virtual meeting from both devices.
