# Programming with Python
This activity introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

Students can access the instructions through **bit.ly/coding-activities**.

## Code-Along
For the [code-along activity](TurtleCodeAlong.md), get into Python and start building something with turtle graphics. It will be helpful to take a look at the Blooket questions and answers before leading the code-along; that way, you can make a point of emphasizing the information covered by the quiz.

### Video
[Click here to watch a video of the code-along activity.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpRnlfyHjiA)

>Note: The video is not interactive, but the actual activity should be _extremely_ interactive!

### Tips
- Make sure to walk through the code-along ahead of time to ensure that you understand it well
- Ask the students questions as often as possible
    - Ask for variable names, colors, number values - anything!
    - Ask what to type next when it's something they've seen before (e.g., parentheses, period, quotation marks)
- Encourage students to make their own choices in the code
- Take it slow at first, and always check to see how the students are progressing
    - Don't trust them to tell you; make sure to actually have someone look at their screens

## Challenges & Examples
The students should have a chance to attempt the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md). They can also look at the [examples](TurtleExamples.md) for inspiration. If they want to take one of the examples and play with it, that is highly encouraged! This part is all about letting the students have fun with code.

### Tips
- Focus on the fun
- Encourage online research
- If a student asks a question and you don't know the answer - help them google it!
- Give students the chance to learn on their own, but give direct help if they are stuck

## Blooket
If the students are not actively playing with the code at the end, facilitate a Blooket quiz activity:

1. Create a Blooket account (should be quick and does not require email verification)
1. Log into Blooket
1. Open the question set here: [Python Quiz](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6411d319d61ef3b555495ea5)
1. Host the game
1. Select *Fishing Frenzy* as the game mode
1. Set the time based on however long remains before the end of the activity
1. Start the game
1. Award the top three players candy
