# Ohio Tech Day Lesson Plan: Python
A workshop introducing [Python](https://www.python.org/) in ~1.5hrs. Python is a popular multi-purpose programming language used by professional and hobbyist developers alike. It can be used to develop games, build websites, control robots, and more.

## Learning Objectives
Students will be able to...

- List some of the use cases for Python (web development, scripting, game development, A.I.)
- Store objects in variables
- Create interesting, unique, and creative patterns using Python Turtle scripts

## Lesson Outline
This lesson has three main parts.

### Lecture: Python
Present the [Python PowerPoint Presentation](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx). There are notes in the slides. Make sure to keep this relatively quick. The final slide contains a URL for the students to visit - this is where they will begin the code-along.

### Code-Along: Turtle
Walk through the [code-along](TurtleCodeAlong.md) with the students. They should type along with the code for the project, building up a simple Turtle program that draws a couple of shapes. If desired, take some time to explain how concepts like variables and the cartesian plane relate to the code.

#### Deviations
The students should be able to:

- Name their `shelly` Turtle variable something different (must be a proper variable name)
- Choose their own colors
- Update any variable/parameter values

Other than those things, they should follow the instructor's code.

### Supplemental: Examples & Challenges
After the code-along, show the students some of the [challenges](TurtleChallenges.md) and encourage them to complete them. Additionally, show some more [examples](TurtleExamples.md) of things they can do with Turtles. Show them that they can edit the code in the examples directly, or copy the code into their own projects.

Hopefully, students will take this time to create things on their own, and follow their own paths.

### Formative Assessment: Blooket
Close out the lesson by facilitating the [Blooket quiz game](https://dashboard.blooket.com/set/6411d319d61ef3b555495ea5). This quiz covers content from the coding activity.
