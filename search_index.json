This includes things like fonts, colors, and more.\nStackBlitz is a website that lets developers create websites.\n\nClick here to view the Google Slides presentation that covers these concepts in more detail.\nSetup\nTo get started, follow the steps below.\n\nOpen up Google Chrome\nGo to the Starter Website Project\ntinyurl.com/startweb2023\n\n\nIn the upper left, click on the \"Fork\" button \n\nNow you have your own copy of a website to start editing!\nLooking at the HTML\nMake sure the index.html file is selected on the left to view the HTML code. Notice how the code in the HTML creates the text on the website.\nElements\nEvery individual thing you see on a website is an HTML element. Elements in HTML can be headers, blocks of text, pictures, videos, or anything else! Elements are the building blocks of HTML websites.\nTags\nHTML elements are created with tags. Tags tell the website what type of element to display. Most HTML elements have an opening tag and a closing tag, with some content in between.\nFor example, the header at the top of the website is created with these components:\n\nOpening Tag: \nContent: My Website\nClosing Tag: \n\nEach tag is surrounded with these symbols:  and >. You may recognize these from math as greater-than and less-than signs - in HTML, we also call these angle brackets. To break down the example further, the  opening tag is created with these components:\n\nLeft Angle Bracket: \nElement Name: h1\nRight Angle Bracket: >\n\nFor closing tags, there is also a slash (/) right before the element name, like this: .\nChallenge: Update the Header\nNow that you have some background information, the first thing to do is update the header text with your name! For example, if my name were Katara, I could change the header so that it said Katara's Website.\nUpdate the code in the HTML section, between the  and  tags. It should look something like this:\nKatara's Website\n\nSave the website by pressing Ctrl+S or Cmd+S on the keyboard, or by clicking the \"Save\" button:\n\nOnce you save the file, take a look at the web preview on the right - make sure your new header text shows up!\n\nNote: It may be necessary to make two changes and save twice; StackBlitz can be a little glitchy\n\nAdding a Welcome Paragraph\nNow it's time to add a totally new element. The paragraph element is used to display normal text on a webpage. Its tags are  and , with text content between.\n\nMake a new line underneath the \nAdd a  opening tag on the new line\nEnter some text that will be displayed\nAt the end of the line, add a  to close the paragraph element\nSave the code, and verify that the message appears on the website!\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nHi, I'm Katara. Welcome to my website!\n\nAdding a List of Hobbies\nNext, it's time to add some information about yourself. Think of some hobbies or activities you enjoy, and then follow the instructions to list them on your website!\n\nAdd an  saying \"My Hobbies\" beneath the  element\nThis will display a slightly smaller header than h1\n\n\nOn the next line, add a  opening tag, and make a new indented line\nCan you guess what the ul element will be? An unordered list!\n\n\nUnder the , add an  with one of your hobbies as the content\nCan you guess what the li element will be? A list item!\n\n\nAdd at least one more li element on the next line\nAt the end of the list, add a  to complete the element\nSave the code, and verify that the list appears on the website!\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nMy Hobbies\n\n    Reading\n    Writing\n    Petting Cats\n\n\nAdding a Cool Image\nAlmost every website has at least one image, and yours can too!\nCreating the Image Element\nFirst, add the code for an image element in the HTML.\n\nMake a new line under the \nAdd another  saying \"A Cool Image\"\nMake a new line under that\nAdd a new element: \nAfter the img, before the >, type in src=\"\"\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nA Cool Image\n\n\nNote that this element is a little different - there is no closing tag!\nFinding an Image\nThe next thing to do is find an image. Images on websites have URLs which tell the browser where to look for them. Follow the instructions below to find the URL (or address) of an image, and copy it.\n\nOpen a new browser tab and go to Google Images\nSearch for something appropriate (such as \"cats\")\nClick on the image you would like to use\nWhen it appears, right click and select Copy image address\nDo not copy the image itself, that will not work!\n\n\nOpen the code again\nClick right between \" and \" in the  element\nPaste the image URL by pressing Ctrl+V\nRun the project, and make sure that the picture shows up!\n\nThe code should end up looking something like this:\n\n\nYour picture might be really big, but don't worry! We can use CSS to change that.\nChanging the Background Color with CSS\nNow the content of the page is looking pretty good, but it's not very stylish. One way to make the website look more fun and exciting is to use CSS! HTML is like the body of a webpage, just the structure, and CSS is like the clothes that it wears, giving it style.\nOn the left side of the page, open the style.css file by clicking on it:\n\nTake a look at the code so far. Try to figure out how to change the background color from white to another color, like pink!\nThe code should look something like this:\nbody {\n    background: pink;\n}\n\nChanging More with CSS\nCSS can change almost anything on a website. For this activity, update the text color, size, and font! All changes should take place in the style.css file.\nUpdating the Text Color\nFollow these instructions to change the text color on your website.\n\nFind the line where the background color is set\nMake a new line underneath that line (above the })\nType in color, followed by a colon (:)\nMake a space, and type in a new color (like red) followed by a semi-colon (;)\n\nSave the code, and verify that the text color changes!\nNote that every CSS property follows the same structure: property name, colon, property value, semi-colon.\nUpdating Font and Size\nNext, update the font and size of the text by following the instructions below.\n\nMake a new line under the color line (still above })\nSet a new property font-family to a value of monospace\nproperty name, colon, property value, semi-colon\n\n\nMake another new line, still above }\nSet another new property font-size to a value of 18px\nproperty name, colon, property value, semi-colon\nCan you guess what px means? Pixels!\n\n\n\nSave the code, and verify that the text changes font and size! Feel free to try changing the numbers or the font to see what works.\nThe code should look something like this:\nbody {\n  background: pink;\n  color: red;\n  font-family: monospace;\n  font-size: 18px;\n}\n\nResizing the Image\nSometimes, images from online are way too big. It is possible to resize them using CSS!\nAdd this code to the style.css file (at the bottom):\nimg {\n    height: 200px;\n}\n\nThat should resize the image to a more appropriate height. Feel free to try changing the number to see what works.\nUsing Custom Colors\nSome basic colors are built into the web (like pink and red), but it is also possible to use custom colors! Each color can be represented as an rgb value. The easiest way to find a specific color is to use a color picker. Luckily, StackBlitz has a color picker built right into the code editor! Follow the steps below to update the colors on the website.\n\nGo to the style.css file\nHover over the existing color name\nDrag the selectors around to find a new color\nSave the project, and verify that the new background color appears on the website!\nRepeat the steps above to change the color of the text to another custom color\n\nThe CSS code should look something like this:\nbody {\n    background: rgb(255, 80, 80);\n    color: rgb(0, 255, 255);\n    font-family: consolas;\n    font-size: 18px;\n}\n\nFinishing Up\nHopefully your website is looking good by now! It might look something like this:\n\nCongratulations, you've successfully built your own website!\nSharing\nTo share your website, it will be necessary to log into StackBlitz with a GitHub account.\nAdditional Topics\nIf there is time remaining, there are a lot of additional updates to be made.

In order to make the setup quicker, you can use the following credentials:\n\nusername: hylandstudent\npassword: hyland\n\nOpen up a Google Chrome browser, and follow these steps:\n\nGo to the existing Heart-Healthy Website\nAt the top of the page, find and click the \"Fork\" button to create a fork of this project \nIf you already have an account, click the \"log in\" link \nFrom there, enter your account information and click the \"Log in\" button \nNext, click the \"Run\" button at the top of the page to build the website from the HTML \nVerify that both the HTML code and the website appear on the page!\nNOTE: Make sure to zoom in so everything is easy to read\n\n\n\nAt this point, it should look something like this:\n\nLooking at the HTML\nNotice how the code in the HTML creates the text on the website. Everything in HTML goes between tags, which tell the website what type of element to display.\n\nThe text between the  and  tags becomes a large header\nThe text between the  and  tags becomes normal sized text\nThe text within the  and  tags are bulleted items in a list\n\nThe website looks okay, but there's a lot we can do to make it better. The first thing to do is update the header text with your name! For example, if my name were Katara, I could change the header so that it said Katara's Heart Healthy Website.\nUpdate the code in the HTML section, between the  and  tags. It should look something like this:\nKatara's Heart Healthy Website\n\nClick the \"Run\" button again, and make sure the text on the website updates with the new header!\nAdding an Image\nAlmost every website has at least one image, and we would like our website to have one too! In fact, the code already has the proper tag in place! All we need to do is find an image, and paste the URL into the HTML code.\n\nGo to the Heart Images page, and find a heart that you like\nCopy the URL listed above the heart by highlighting the text, right clicking, and selecting \"Copy\"\nGo back to the Repl\nIn the HTML section, find the  tag\nClick right between the two quotes (\" and \")\nPaste in the URL by right clicking and selecting \"Paste\"\nVerify that the image appears on the website!\n\nThe code for the image should look something like this:\n\n\nUpdating the List\nCurrently, the list of heart-healthy foods only has placeholder items. We want it to have some real foods! Update the HTML code so that the website displays a list of foods.\n\nGo to the Heart-Healthy Foods page to find a list of some heart healthy foods\nSelect three of your favorite foods from the list\nGo back to the Repl\nIn the HTML section, find the  tags\nThis is code for the list on the website!\n\n\nUpdate the text between each  and  with one of the heart-healthy foods from the list\nVerify that the new foods appear in the list on the website!\n\nThe code for the list should look something like this:\n\n  \n    Beans\n  \n  \n    Spinach\n  \n  \n    Dark Chocolate\n  \n\n\nUpdating the Colors\nSo far, we have updated the content of the website with HTML, but we haven't done anything with the style. That's where CSS comes in! CSS can change the style of the page, without affecting the content.\n\nTake a look at the code within the  tags, and try to figure out what it does\nFind the area where it sets the background color - background: white\nChange the \"white\" to \"pink\" to change the background color\nNext, find the area where the CSS sets the text color - color: black\nChange the \"black\" to \"red\" to change the text color\nClick the \"Run\" button again, and verify that the colors have updated on the website!\n\nThe CSS code should look something like this:\nbody {\n    font-family: arial;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    background: pink;\n    color: red;\n}\n\nUsing Custom Colors\nSome basic colors are built into the web (like pink and red), but it is also possible to use custom colors! Each color can be represented as a hexidecimal color code, which is a hashtag (#) followed by six alphanumeric characters. The easiest way to find a specific color is to use a color picker. Follow the steps below to update the colors on the website.\n\nGo to Google's Color Picker\nDrag the two sliders around to select a new shade of pink \nOnce a color is selected, highlight the \"HEX\" code text under the color picker, and copy it\n \nGo back to the Repl\nRemove the \"pink\" from the CSS, and paste in the new hex code\nVerify that the new background color appears on the website!\nRepeat the steps above to change the color of the text to another custom color\n\nThe CSS code should look something like this:\nbody {\n    font-family: arial;\n    font-size: 20px;\n    background: #ffbdbd;\n    color: #bf3636;\n}\n\nFinishing Up\nOur website is looking pretty good now!

For example, if you have two laptops, you could join the Bizzabo meeting from one of the laptops, and write code on the other laptop.\nAn ideal situation for a Chromebook user would be to also have access to a laptop or desktop to use as a second device. That said, if you do not have any other devices, we hope you still try to participate as best you can! \nWe do not recommend using a phone or tablet as your only device for the virtual activity. This is because the size of those screens may make it difficult to participate in the activities. If you must use one, it may be easier to watch instead of following along.\n\nBefore the Activity\nMake sure you can properly open Repl on your device. It should look like this:\n\nFrom there, click on the \"Fork\" button at the top of the page:  \n\nIn the pop-up window, enter some new account information, and click the \"Sign up\" button:  \n\nNow you have a Repl account!

They have to make an account in order to save. Students should make note of their pen's URL so they can recover their code and share it!\nInteractivity with JavaScript\nExplain that JavaScript is the programming language of the web, that allows webpages to be interactive. Developers use JavaScript to trigger events, create animations, make games, and much more!\nThe next step for the CodePen site is to add functionality to the \"Quiz Me\" button. It should pop up a quiz that allows the user to answer some questions and receive a final score. This is possible with JavaScript!\nDefining the Function\nDevelopers use functions in JavaScript to trigger certain actions. In this example, clicking the \"Quiz Me\" button will call a JavaScript function. That means it triggers some actions! alert is the command that lets developers show messages to the user on a webpage.\n\nExpand the JS portion of the code in CodePen\nCreate an empty function definition for the startQuiz function\nThis requires the function keyword, the function name, parentheses, and curly brackets\n\n\nIn the body of the function, add an alert statement that welcomes the user\nIf desired, introduce the Windows emoji keyboard (Windows key + semi-colon key)\n\n\nOn the webpage, click the button to make sure it is hooked up properly!\nNote that this is possible because of the onclick attribute on the HTML button\n\n\n\nfunction startQuiz() {\n    alert(\"Welcome to my quiz 🙂\");\n}\n\nReceiving Information from the User\nprompt is a command that allows us to ask questions to the user. When the user answers, the computer stores that text in a variable. Developers can then reference that information in the future!\n\nUnder the alert, above the }, create a couple new lines\nDeclare a name variable. How can we ask the user for their name?\nUse a prompt to ask for the user's name\n\n\nOn the next line, use an alert to say \"Good luck\" to the user (using their name!)\n\nvar name = prompt(\"What is your name?\");\nalert(\"Good luck \" + name);\n\nSetting up the Quiz Variables\n\nUnder the previous alert, above the }, create a couple new lines\nDeclare a points variable\nThis will be used to keep track of how many points the user has earned (i.e., how many questions they have answered correctly)\nHow many points should the user have at the beginning? (0)\n\n\nDeclare a numberOfQuestions variable\nTo start, set this value to 2\n\n\n\nvar points = 0;\nvar numberOfQuestions = 2;\n\nAsking a Question\nif statements allow developers to change the program flow based on certain information. It works just like in English; for example, \"if it is raining, I will wear a raincoat.\" In code, the program will do different things based on what the user says! For the quiz, the points should go up every time the user answers correctly. So, \"if the answer from the user is equal to the correct answer, increase the points!\"\n\nUnder the numberOfQuestions variable declaration, above the }, create a couple new lines\nAsk the user a question using prompt (e.g., \"What is my name?\")\nStore the user's answer in a variable called answer1\nUnder the prompt, create an if statement\nWhat should happen based on the user's answer?\nIf the user is correct, they should get a point. Otherwise, they should not.\n\n\nUse if, parentheses, ===, and curly brackets to set up the if\nWithin the curly brackets, use ++ to increment the value of the points variable\n\nvar answer1 = prompt(\"What is my name?\");\nif (answer1 === \"Joseph\") {\n    points++;\n}\n\nNOTE: The students should check the answer against their own name\nAsking another Question\n\nRepeat the steps above to ask another question underneath the first question\nThe differences will be:\nanswer2 instead of answer1 for the variable\nAsk a different question\nCheck a different answer\n\n\n\nvar answer2 = prompt(\"Where do I live?\");\nif (answer2 === \"Lakewood\") {\n    points++;\n}\n\nNOTE: The students should check the answer against where they live\nCalculating the Final Score\nFinally, it is possible to use the points variable to determine an overall score. Do some math to calculate the percentage against the total questions!\n\nNOTE: This section can be skipped and replaced with an alert that simply displays the number of points at the end\n\n\nConsider how to calculate the final score\nThe score will be the number of points the user has, divided by the total number of questions\nMultiply this by 100 to show a percentage\n\n\nUnder the final question, declare a finalScore variable\nCalculate the final score by dividing the points variable by the numberOfQuestions variable\nMultiply this by 100 to show a percentage\n\n\nUse an alert to show the final score to the user\n\nvar finalScore = (points / numberOfQuestions) * 100;\nalert(\"Final score: \" + finalScore + \"%\");\n\nFinal CodePen Webpage\nhttps://codepen.io/jmaxwell/pen/BaBVVrO\nChallenges\nIf there is time remaining, students can attempt the challenges.

The instructor should act as a computer and follow each step as literally as possible. If there is ambiguity, or if a step is not possible to complete, the instructor should point out the error. When an instruction is ambiguous or impossible, the instructor should interpret the algorithm in the most atypical (and hilarious) way possible.  This will reinforce to students that many seemingly clear instructions can be taken many ways.\nCommon Errors\n\nFailing to open a container before using what is inside\nResponse: Try (and fail) to access the inside in a humorous fashion (e.g. try to reach through the bag or jar, acting confused as to why you cannot reach the ingredient inside)\n\n\nFailing to specify in which orientation or position to use something (e.g. \"grab the knife\" but not by the handle, \"put down the bread\" but not on the plate)\nResponse: use or place the ingredient in an obviously (and humorously) incorrect way (e.g. grab the knife (carefully) by the sharp end, put the slice of bread on the table next to plate, spread peanut butter around the crust instead of on the face)\n\n\nUsing instructions that are too broad (e.g. \"pick up the bread\" to mean a single slice, \"put the peanut butter on the bread\" to mean spreading a small amount)\nResponse: Ask for more detail, or interpret the instruction literally\n\n\nCombining multiple steps into one instruction (e.g. \"spread peanut butter on the bread\" without specifically opening the jar, putting peanut butter on the knife, using the knife to spread, etc.)\nResponse: Ask for more detail\n\n\n\nMost algorithms will fail. Instructors should read through many students' instructions for a while.\nDebugging\nDebugging is an important part of writing computer programs. Once enough students have had their instructions executed, give them a chance to rewrite their algorithms, fixing any of the failures from the original execution. There are more slides in the presentation to introduce debugging.\nSuggested Schedule\n\n\n\nActivity\nTime\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction Presentation\n10m\n\n\nStudents Writing Algorithms\n5-10m\n\n\nExecuting Instructions\n10-15m\n\n\nDebugging Presentation\n5m\n\n\nStudents Debugging Algorithms\n5-10m\n\n\nWrap Up\n0-5m\n\n\n\n"},"SnapAnimationLesson/StudentDesc.html":{"url":"SnapAnimationLesson/StudentDesc.html","title":"Snap!

They can be dragged to the Scripts section to create code.\nScripts: This central part is where the code for the program lives. Drag blocks from the Blocks section into this section to create code.\nStage: On the top right, this is where the program will execute. This is how users interact with the developed applications.\nSprites: On the bottom right, this is where all of the sprites appear. A sprite is a character or object within a Snap application that can interact with the user.\n\nBasic Sprite Movement\n\nAt the top of the Blocks section, click Control to view the Control blocks\nFind the  block, and drag it to the Scripts area  \nAt the top of the Blocks section, click Motion to view the Motion blocks\nFind the \"change x by {10}\" block, and snap it under the \"when\" block in the Scripts area: \nOn the \"when\" block, click the dropdown where it says \"space\" and change it to \"right arrow\"\nOn the Stage, see the sprite move to the right while pressing the right arrow key!\n\nCreate similar movement scripts for left, up, and down. Note that the \"change x by...\" block will move the sprite horizontally (left and right), and the \"change y by...\" block will move the sprite vertically (up and down).\nLeft and Right\n\nWithin the \"if\" blocks for left and right movement, add  blocks so that the sprite faces the proper direction\nUse the dropdown to set the direction\n\n\nAbove the Sprites area, click the two-sided arrow to make the sprite only face left or right, not upside down: \n\nSmoother Movements\nWith the existing code, the sprite does not move very smoothly. Update the code so that it constantly checks if a keys are pressed instead of simply responding to keypresses.\n\nDrag all of the code scripts out of the stage so they disappear\nDrag over a  block from the Control section\nThis will cause the following blocks to execute when the user clicks the green flag\n\n\nUnder the \"When\" block, drag over a  block from the Control section\nThis will cause the blocks within to execute repeatedly forever\n\n\nWithin the \"forever\" block, drag a  block\nIn the empty space next to the \"if\", drag a  block from the Sensing section\nWithin the \"key pressed\" block, click the dropdown where it says \"space\" and change it to \"left arrow\"\nThis will cause the blocks within the \"if\" to execute only if the left arrow key is pressed\n\n\nWithin the \"if\" block, drag a  block from the Motion section\nChange the value to \"-3\"\n\n\nAbove the \"change\" block, add a  block so that the sprite faces the proper direction\nUse the dropdown to set the direction\n\n\nAbove the Sprites area, click the two-sided arrow to make the sprite only face left or right, not upside down: \nClick the green flag, and see the sprite move on the Stage while pressing the right arrow key!\n\n\n\nNote: If the sprite goes off the screen, right click it in the Sprites section and select \"show\"\n\nUpdate the movement scripts for right, up, and down as well. Make sure to point in the proper direction when moving to the right!\nChanging the Background\nIn Snap!, it is possible to change the background to an image.\n\nOpen a new tab in Google Chrome, and go to Google images\nFind a suitable background image that is the proper size\nThe default size for a Snap! stage is 480x360\n\n\nRight click the image, and save it to the desktop\nGo back to Snap!, and in the Sprites area, click on the Stage\nClick on the \"Backgrounds\" tab\nDrag the new background image into the Backgrounds area!\n\nAnimation with Costumes\nIn Snap!, it is possible to give costumes to sprites. Developers can create animations by switching a sprite's costumes quickly.\nSetting up the Costumes\n\nIn the top menu, click the File icon and select \"Costumes...\" from the list: \nIn the costume selection pop-up, scroll down and double click on \"avery walking a\", \"avery walking b\", \"avery walking c\", and \"avery walking d\": \nVerify that each costume appears in the sprite's Costumes area: \n\nAnimating the Sprite\nThe costumes should change when the sprite is walking. This happens when either the right key OR the left key is pressed.\n\nDrag over another  block\nUnder the \"When\" block, drag over another  block\nWithin the \"forever\" block, drag a  block\nFrom the Operators section, drag a  block into the Scripts area\nThis block allows developers to check if one thing or another are true\n\n\nDrag a  block into the first space in the \"or\" block\nDrag another  block into the second space in the \"or\" block\nSet the dropdown for the \"key pressed\" blocks to be \"left\" and \"right\"\nWithin the \"if\" block, drag a  from the Looks section\nThis will switch the costume of the sprite!\n\n\nTest out the code and see the animation happen when moving the sprite left or right!\n\nSlower Animation Speed\nAdd a  block under the \"next costume\" block so the costumes do not change constantly.

C# is an object-oriented programming language, often used to make desktop applications. This lesson covers console output and methods. The goal of the lesson is to build a simple piece of ASCII art using the C# console.\nSetup\nFollow the Setup guide to get ready to build an introductory program with repl.it!\nIntroduction to ASCII Art\nASCII Art is a graphic design technique that uses text characters to create images.\nExamples\nCheck out some examples of ASCII Art here: imgur.com/a/u9Rjhov\n\n\n\nDrawing a Bunny in C#\nStart by placing this bunny in a text file:\n () ()\n (^ ^)\n (___)\nUsing the C# console, it is possible to create interesting text-based art (like bunnies) using Console.WriteLine. Right now, it should show some text containing a message, but it can show any text at all! A developer simply needs to write out each line of ASCII text in the proper order. Try to recreate the bunny in the C# console!\n\nRemove the existing code from body of the Main method\nAdd a Console.WriteLine statement to draw the bunny's ears\nAdd another Console.WriteLine statement to draw the bunny's face\nAdd a third Console.WriteLine statement to draw the bunny's body\nAdd an empty Console.WriteLine statement to add some space under the bunny\nMake sure each piece of text starts with a space\nClick the \"run\" button to see the bunny appear in the console!\n\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n  public static void Main (string[] args) {\n    Console.WriteLine(\" () () \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\" (^ ^) \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\" (___) \");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n  }\n}\n\nSetting the Console Colors\nIt is possible to change the colors of the C# console. There is a limited set of colors, but they can make the console a little bit more fun.\nAt the top of the body of the Main method, add the following code:\nConsole.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\nConsole.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;\nConsole.Clear();\n\nThis will set the colors, and then clear the existing console so that the colors apply to everything. Make sure the capitalization is consistent!\nTry out a few different colors to see what works.\nChallenge: Drawing Multiple Bunnies\nInstead of drawing one bunny, draw a few bunnies lined up vertically. Use Console.WriteLine() to put an empty line in between them. Try to make all of the bunnies look the same!\nUsing Methods\nThe code starts to get a little more disorganized with each additional bunny. There is a lot of repeated code that does the exact same thing, and it becomes difficult to maintain. Luckily, methods can make this code better!\nA method is a block of code that runs when it is called. This allows developers to reuse code; they can define the code once, and use it many times.\nQuestions\n\nQ: Where is there already a method in the program?\nA: The Main method! This is the entry point for the exeuction of a C# program.\nQ: For this program, what kind of method could help simplify the code?\nA: How about a method to draw a bunny!\n\nDefining the Method\n\nUnder the Main method (after the }), start defining the method with public static void\nThese keywords set certain things about the method. They are outside of the scope of this lesson\n\n\nAdd the name of the method: DrawBunny\nAdd parentheses and curly brackets (() {})\nClick in between the opening and closing curly brackets and press the Enter key\nIn the body of the DrawBunny method, add the code to draw a bunny!\n\npublic static void DrawBunny() {\n    Console.WriteLine(\" () () \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\" (^ ^) \");\n    Console.WriteLine(\" (___) \");\n    Console.WriteLine();\n}\n\nCalling the Method\n\nRemove all of the bunny-drawing code from the body of the Main method\nBe sure to keep the console color code though!\n\n\nCall the DrawBunny method in the code with DrawBunny();\nAdd a few additional method calls under the first one\nClick the \"run\" button to run the code and see the bunnies appear!\n\nAdding Whiskers\nOne of the best things about methods is that if a developer wants to update code, they only have to do it in one place. For example, to add whiskers to the bunny, it is only necessary to change one line of code instead of several. This change will apply to every method call!\n\nIn the DrawBunny method, find the line that draws the bunny's face\nAdd a greater-than sign (>) on the left side of the bunny's face\nAdd a less-than sign () on the right side of the bunny's face\nClick the \"run\" button to run the code again and see each bunny appear with whiskers!\n\nChallenge: An Additional Bunny Method\nDefine a new method under the existing method to draw the same bunny, but using an o for the eyes! The method definition should look almost exactly the same as the DrawBunny definition, but it should have a new name (DrawBunny2) and have o instead of ^ in the Console.WriteLine for the face.\nCode\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n    public static void Main (string[] args) {\n        Console.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\n        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;\n        Console.Clear();\n\n        DrawBunny();\n        DrawBunny();\n        DrawBunny();\n    }\n\n    public static void DrawBunny() {\n        Console.WriteLine(\" () () \");\n        Console.WriteLine(\">(^ ^)\nOPTIONAL: Method Parameters\nThe two methods, DrawBunny and DrawBunny2, are very similar. What are the differences?\n\nThe method names\nThe character used for the eyes\n\nInstead of writing these two methods that are almost identical, it is possible to use method parameters to make the one method a little more dynamic. Method parameters allow developers to pass information to methods when they are called, so they can do different things depending on that information.\nFor this program, the eye is what will change with different method calls. The eye could be any piece of text at all, so the code in the body of the DrawBunnyEye method should not draw any eyes directly! Instead, it should insert the eye into the text dynamically.\n\nUnder the existing method definitions, define a new method named DrawBunnyEye\nCopy the existing definition for DrawBunny, but change the name\n\n\nAdd a parameter within the parentheses in the method definition: string eye\nUpdate the code so that instead of using . for the eye, it uses whatever the user passed in (eye):   Console.WriteLine($\">({eye} {eye})\n\nIn the body of the Main method, call the DrawBunnyEye method, but put \"^\" inside the parentheses\nCall the DrawBunnyEye method with a couple other eye values\nRemove the other method definitions and calls, as they are no longer necessary\nClick the \"run\" button to run the code again, and see the bunnies with all the different eyes!\n\nFinal Code\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n    public static void Main (string[] args) {\n        Console.BackgroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\n        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.DarkBlue;\n        Console.Clear();\n\n        DrawBunnyEye(\"^\");\n        DrawBunnyEye(\"$\");\n        DrawBunnyEye(\"0\");\n    }\n\n    public static void DrawBunnyEye(string eye) {\n        Console.WriteLine(\" () () \");\n        Console.WriteLine($\">({eye} {eye})\nNext Steps\nTry to create some different works of text-based art! Find some online by Google searching \"ASCII Art\" or make up your own! It can be helpful to start in Notepad before trying to write code.\n\nNOTE: Using the backslash (\\) character can cause issues when writing text to the screen. To avoid this, use \\\\ instead of \\, and only one \\ will appear.\n\n"},"CSharpLessons/CyaLesson.html":{"url":"CSharpLessons/CyaLesson.html","title":"Choose Your Own Adventure","keywords":"","body":"C#: Choose Your Own Adventure\nAn activity to introduce C# in 45-60m. C# is an object-oriented programming language, often used to make desktop applications. This lesson covers input/output from the console, variables, and conditional statements. The goal of the lesson is to build a simple Choose Your Own Adventure game using the C# console.\nSetup\nFollow the Setup guide to get ready to build an introductory program with Replit!\nUser Input\nThe Choose Your Own Adventure game should allow the user to decide how the story plays out. To do that, the program must ask a question, and remember the user's answer. \n\nAdd another Console.WriteLine statement under the first one, and make it say \"You wake up. What do you do?\"\nMake sure everything is capitalized correctly\nMake sure there are parentheses (()) and quotes (\"\")\nMake sure there is a semi-colon (;) at the end of the statement\n\n\nUnder the Console.WriteLine statement, add another statement to read the user's answer:   string answer = Console.ReadLine();\n\n\n\nNow answer is a variable that holds the answer from the user. A variable is a name that points to a value in the code. A variable can hold anything, and the program can even change what it holds. For now, the answer variable allows the program to remember the user's answer to the question.\n\nMake another new line under the string answer statement, and add a Console.WriteLine\nMake the statement say \"You said \"\nAfter the \"You said \" ending quote, add + answer so that the answer is added to the end of the message:   Console.WriteLine(\"You said \" + answer);\n\n\nRun the program, and test that the user's answer to the question is said back!\n\nBranching\nNow, the program should change the story based on the user's answer. This is possible with if statements. These work just like in English; for example, \"if it is raining, I will stay indoors.\" For the story, the program can create different outcomes in this way.\n\nCreate a new line under the last Console.WriteLine statement\nAdd an if statement to check whether the answer is equal to the text \"Go back to sleep\":   if (answer == \"Go back to sleep\")\n\n\nAdd curly brackets ({ and }) to open up the body of the if statement\nAll of the code in between those brackets will only run if the check is true!\n\n\nCreate a new line after the opening bracket ({)\nOn the new line, add a Console.WriteLine saying \"You sleep happily.\"\nRun the code, and check that the next line appears when entering \"Go back to sleep\"\n\nCode\nif (answer == \"Go back to sleep\") {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You sleep happily.\");\n}\n\nAnother Answer\nNow the program can respond to one answer, but what about another one? Use another if statement to check if the user entered a different answer.\n\nAfter the closing curly bracket (}) for the if, make a new line and add a new if statement\nIn the parentheses, check if answer is equal to the text \"Get up\"\nAdd opening and closing curly brackets after the parentheses\nWithin the curly brackets, add a Console.WriteLine to say \"You get out of bed.\"\nRun the code, and check that the proper line appears when entering \"Get up\"\n\nCode\nif (answer == \"Get up\") {\n    Console.WriteLine(\"You get out of bed.\");\n}\n\nContinuing the Story\nAfter the user gets out of bed, the program can again ask how to proceed. Everything within the curly brackets of the second if will run only if the user said to get up. So, it is possible to ask another question within that branch!\n\nUnder the \"You get out of bed\" line, add another Console.WriteLine asking the user what they would like to do next\nUse Console.ReadLine again to take in the user's answer, and store it in a variable named answer2\nIf the user says to go to school, write a message saying \"You learn a lot at school!\"\nOtherwise, if the user says to go to the movies, write a message saying \"You get in trouble :(\"\nRun the code, and test that the different branches work as expected!\n\nFinal Code\nusing System;\n\nclass MainClass {\n    public static void Main (string[] args) {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Welcome to my game!\");\n        Console.WriteLine(\"You wake up. What do you do?\");\n        string answer = Console.ReadLine();\n\n        if (answer == \"Go back to sleep\") {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"You sleep happily.\");\n        }\n\n        if (answer == \"Get up\") {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"You get out of bed.\");\n            Console.WriteLine(\"What do you do next?\");\n            string answer2 = Console.ReadLine();\n\n            if (answer2 == \"Go to school\") {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"You learn a lot at school!\");\n            }\n\n            if (answer2 == \"Go to the movies\") {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"You get in trouble :(\");\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNext Steps\nTry to continue the story with some new branches!

To make it more fun, use links to allow the user to choose a path for the main character.\n\nDouble click the \"The Beginning\" passage to edit it again\nMake a few new lines under the existing text\nTo create a link, add another line of text, surrounded by [[ and ]]\nFor example, [[Wake up]]\n\n\nTo create another option for the user, add another link beneath the existing link\nFor example, [[Stay in bed]]\n\n\nClose out of the \"The Beginning\" passage, and notice that two new passages were automatically created\nDouble click the first branch, and fill in some text\nEx: You wake up and get out of bed, ready to face the day!\n\n\nDouble click the second branch, and fill in some different text\nEx: You continue to sleep happily.\n\n\nClick \"Play\" again to see how the links work in the story!\n\nChallenge: Branching the Branch\nChoose one of the paths, and add another pair of branches to continue the story. Use links [[like this]] to create the branching passages.\nStyling the Story with CSS\nCSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a styling language for the web. Almost every website uses CSS to change fonts, colors, layouts, and much more!\nOPTIONAL: CSS in a Web Browser\nIt is possible to demonstrate the use of CSS in Google Chrome using Chrome DevTools. This toolset allows developers to update CSS for a webpage right from the browser!\n\nOpen a new tab in Google Chrome, and go to a Wikipedia page\nEx: Choose Your Own Adventure\n\n\nPress the F12 key to open Chrome DevTools\nThis allows developers to see all of the HTML and CSS that creates the webpage\n\n\nFind the \"Styles\" section, and click the + button to create a new style rule \nFor the style selector, enter body\nThis means that the styles will apply to everything on page\n\n\nClick in between the curly brackets ({ and })\nType in font-size: 20px, and press the Enter key\nThis should make the text on the page bigger\n\n\nClick between the curly brackets again, and type in font-family: cursive\nThis should change the font of the text on the page\n\n\n\nbody {\n    font-size: 20px;\n    font-family: cursive;\n}\n\nThese are only a couple of the styles in CSS. There are many more to explore!\nCSS in Twine\nTwine hosts stories on the web, so it is possible to use CSS to update the styles for those pages too!\n\nGo back to the Twine story page in Chrome\nIn the lower left corner, click the story name menu and select \"Edit Story Stylesheet\"\nAdd some CSS to update the font-size, font-family, text color, and background-color for the story:   body {\n     font-size: 20px;\n     font-family: consolas;\n     color: lightpink;\n     background-color: darkblue;\n }\n\n\nClose out of the stylesheet, and click \"Play\" to see the styles in the story!\n\nOPTIONAL: Choosing Custom Colors for CSS\nSome color names like \"lightpink\" and \"darkblue\" are built into the web already, but it is also possible to choose custom colors using RGB values! The RGB color model is an additive color model in which red, green and blue light are added together in various ways to reproduce a broad array of colors. Basically, it is possible to create any digital color with a combination of red, green, and blue!\nEach color (R, G, and B) can take a number from 0 to 255. This represents the amount of the color in the mix. For example, a color with a Red value of 255, a Green value of 0, and a Blue value of 0 would be red.\nThe combinations are almost endless! Google has a built-in color picker that developers and designers can utilize to find the perfect color. It displays RGB colors in the HEX format like so:\n#7b95a8\nTo use that color in CSS, copy the number (including the #) and paste it into the CSS where a color would go! Try out some different colors for the page to find the best ones.\nTracking Story Information with Variables\nTwine also allows developers to keep track of different details throughout the story using variables. For example, the story could track how much money the main character has, their health level, their age, the weather, the time of day, or anything else!\nOPTIONAL: More on Variables\nIn computer science, variables are containers for information that can change. Variables have a name (e.g., money, health, age) and a value (e.g., $5, 90hp, 11). The value of a variable can change throughout the story, but the name will always stay the same. For example, if the main character in a story bought a banana and ate it, the money variable might go down to $4.69, and the health variable might go up to 95hp.\nCreating the GPA variable\nFor the \"A Day in the Life\" story, the main character's GPA could change depending on the path the user takes. For example, if the main character skips school, their GPA could go down. If they go to school and work hard, their GPA could go up. Create a GPA variable to track this information throughout the story.\n\nIf desired, create a different variable to track a different type of information, like the main character's money, HP, stress, or anything else!\n\n\nDouble click to open the \"The Beginning\" passage\nAt the top of the text, add the code > so the main character begins the story with a GPA of 2.5. Note the syntax:\nLess-than and greater-than signs (>)\nset\nA dollar sign ($)\nThe name of the variable (GPA)\nto\nThe value of the variable (2.5)\n\n\nUnder the > line, add the text GPA: $GPA\nThis will display the value of the variable\n\n\nClose out of the passage and click the \"Play\" button to verify that the GPA appears as expected!\n\nUpdating the GPA Variable\nNow that the main character's GPA has a starting value, it is possible to update it depending on the story branch.\n\nIn Twine, open up one of the passages where the main character's GPA might go down\nAt the top of the text, add the code >\nThis will set the GPA variable to .2 less than it was before\n\n\nClose out of that passage, and open a passage where the main character's GPA would go up\nAt the top of the text, add the code >\nThis will set the GPA variable to .2 more than it was before\n\n\n\nEnding the Day\nEventually, the day in the story will come to an end. When this happens, it would make sense for every story branch to lead to the same place, regardless of how the main character ended up there. At that point, it would also make sense to display the final value for the GPA variable.\n\nUpdate all of the current final passages so they link to a new passage: [[Night falls]]\nDouble click the \"Night falls\" passage to edit it\nAdd some text saying \"The day has passed\" or something similar\nAdd code to display the main character's final GPA\nGPA: $GPA\n\n\nFinally, click the \"Play\" button and play through the story in a few different ways! Try to make the final variable value change on different play-throughs.\n\nOPTIONAL: Next Steps\nTry to continue the story with some new branches! Write it out on paper or in Notepad first to get an idea of where the story should go. Then, try to update the code to make it into a playable game! Feel free to elaborate on the existing story, or change it completely. Have fun!\nChallenge Ideas\n\nAdd a different image to every passage\nAdd a new variable to keep track of something else throughout the story\nAdd several new branches that take the main character on many new adventures\nDo some Google research to learn more about CSS, and update the styles for the story\n\n"},"PythonLesson/TurtleCodeAlong.html":{"url":"PythonLesson/TurtleCodeAlong.html","title":"Python Lesson","keywords":"","body":"Turtle Code-Along\nIn this introductory activity, use turtle graphics to create a drawing in Python!\n\nWhat is Python?\nPython is a popular multi-purpose programming language used by professional and hobbyist developers alike. You can use it to develop games, build websites, control robots, and more!\nGetting Started\nTrinket is a free online tool that lets you write and run Python code right from a web browser!\n\nClick here to go to the Starter Trinket\nClick the \"Expand\" button at the bottom to make it fit a little better if desired \nIn the main.py file on the left, add the following line to import everything from the turtle library: from turtle import *\n\n\nClick the Play button, and notice that nothing happens yet\nMake a new line under the import, and add the following code: shelly = Turtle()\n\n\nshelly is now a Turtle object - but Shelly needs a shape! Under that line, add the following code to give Shelly a shape:   shelly.shape(\"arrow\")\n\n\nRun the code again to see Shelly appear on the screen!\nBONUS: Update the code so that instead of an \"arrow\" shape, the turtle looks like a turtle\n\nThe setup code should look something like this:\nfrom turtle import *\n\nshelly = Turtle()\nshelly.shape(\"arrow\")\n\nAdding Color\nMake things a little more interesting by updating the colors.\n\nMake a new line, and add code to change Shelly's color\nHINT: this is a lot like how the shape was updated - just using color instead\n\n\nOn the next line, add the following code: paper = shelly.getscreen()\n\n\nNow, the paper variable stores the screen. Change its color using bgcolor\nBONUS: Play around with the settings to create a pleasing (or terrible) color scheme!\n\nThe code for the color should look something like this:\nshelly.color(\"green\")\npaper = shelly.getscreen()\npaper.bgcolor(\"gold\")\n\nMoving the Turtle\nOne of the most useful turtle abilities is the ability to move across the screen and draw like a pen! Create a blank line, and then add the following command on the next line:\nshelly.forward(100)\n\nClick the Run button to see the turtle move across the screen! Specifically, it moves forward 100 pixels in the direction it is currently facing (90 degrees).\nIt is also possible to turn the turtle. Add the following command on the next line:\nshelly.right(90)\n\nThis command turns the turtle 90 degrees to the right. Previously the direction of the turtle was 90 degrees (pointing to the right), so after turning 90 degrees to the right, the turtle should face down (180 degrees).\nRun the program again to see the turtle move to the right, then turn to face down!\nDrawing a Square\nAdd the following commands to the file, under the existing commands:\nshelly.forward(100)\nshelly.right(90)\nshelly.forward(100)\nshelly.right(90)\n\nRun the program to see what this code does. It should draw part of a square! How does that work? On a piece of paper, or on a whiteboard, try to draw the same square as the turtle:\n\nDraw the top side from left to right\nTurn the writing utensil and draw the right side from top to bottom\nTurn the writing utensil and draw the bottom side from left to right\n\nSo, the turtle moves 100 pixels to the right, turns 90 degrees to face down, moves 100 pixels down, turns 90 degrees to face left, moves 100 pixels to the left, and then turns 90 degrees to face up!\nThe Rest of the Square\nComplete the square that Shelly is drawing. The code will be the same as the first part of the square:\nshelly.forward(100)\nshelly.right(90)\n\nLooping\nAt this point, there appears to be a lot of repeated lines of code. This isn't too big of a deal, but it could be annoying to change the size of the square, or draw a shape with more sides. Luckily, there is a way to automatically repeat commands: the for loop!\nLooping the Square\nUse a for loop to repeat the code that draws the square.\n\nIdentify the two lines of square-drawing code that repeat\nshelly.forward and shelly.right\n\n\nNotice how many times those two lines repeat: 4\nRemove all repeated instances of that code, so there are only two commands remaining\nIndent the two lines by adding a couple spaces in front of them\nAbove the two lines, not indented, add a for loop\nIt should start with for\nThen, add x in\nThen add range(4):\nNote that it should repeat 4 times\n\n\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nfor x in range(4):\n  shelly.forward(100)\n  shelly.right(90)\n\nMuch shorter, and easier to maintain! Now, to change the size of the square, only one number has to be updated.\nDrawing a Star\nAnother cool thing about for loops is they can repeat any number of times. Three or four times isn't that cool, but repeating 60 times can be very helpful! Use a for loop to draw another type of shape - a star.\nPreparation\nFirst, get to the proper location on the map (without drawing), and change the speed and color as well.\n\nAt the bottom of the file, make a new line\nAdd a command for Shelly to pick up the pen: shelly.penup()\nUnder that, add a command for Shelly to go to a new location: shelly.goto(-100, 50)\nUnder that, have Shelly put the pen back down: shelly.pendown()\nNext, add a command to change Shelly's speed: shelly.speed(20)\nFinally, change Shelly's color to make this shape special: shelly.color(\"purple\")\n\nThe code for this part should look like this:\nshelly.penup()\nshelly.goto(-100, 50)\nshelly.pendown()\nshelly.speed(20)\nshelly.color(\"purple\")\n\nFor Loop\nNow that Shelly is in position, create a new for loop that draws a star shape.\n\nMake a new line at the bottom of the file\nCreate a for loop structure to repeat 60 times\nStart with for\nThen add x in\nFinally, add range(60):\n\n\nUnder the for line, create a new indented line (add a couple spaces in front)\nOn the new indented line, move Shelly forward - 200 pixels\nUnder that, still indented, turn Shelly to the right - 186 pixels\n\nThe code should look something like this:\nfor x in range(60):\n  shelly.forward(200)\n  shelly.right(186)\n\nFeel free to update the numbers to see how the star changes!\nHiding the Turtle\nAt the end, hide the turtle so that the star can be viewed with nothing in the way!\nshelly.hideturtle()\n\nFinal Code\nAt the end of the code-along, the code should look something like this:\nfrom turtle import *\n\nshelly = Turtle()\nshelly.shape(\"turtle\")\n\nshelly.color(\"green\")\n\npaper = shelly.getscreen()\npaper.bgcolor(\"gold\")\n\nfor x in range(4):\n  shelly.forward(100)\n  shelly.right(90)\n\nshelly.penup()\nshelly.goto(-100, 50)\nshelly.pendown()\nshelly.speed(20)\nshelly.color(\"purple\")\n\nfor x in range(60):\n  shelly.forward(200)\n  shelly.right(186)\n\nshelly.hideturtle()\n\nNext Steps\nAfter completing the code-along, take a look at the examples or try out some challenges!\n"},"PythonLesson/TurtleExamples.html":{"url":"PythonLesson/TurtleExamples.html","title":"Examples","keywords":"","body":"Turtle Examples\nOther Turtle Abilities\nTurtles have many additional abilities!
